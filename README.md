# Python---Neural-Network-Without-Libraries

This project is just to increase my knowledge and to practise my coding skills. I love AI, so I decided to attempt to code a neural network with python from scratch, without libraries.

The code is not optimized, operations might be wrong, and code might not be very well documented.

If anyone would like to tell me tips or tricks to optimize my code I'd highly appreciate it, same goes with math or code bugs.

I'll actively update this repository until I get a neural network that can do a simple task:
Classify a 16x16 pixels image into a circle or a cross.
